## MultiItemRowListViewAdpater with Parse objects
---

This was a job done jsut for showing more than one item per row on a listview, what can be customizable for each screen size, and these items must be a Parse object loaded in.


This implements too another third-party library called UniversalImageLoader, just to help load images assyncrhonously and it let me crop square images into circle images easily!

###Libraries:
- Parse (http://parse.com);
- MultiItemRowListViewAdapter (https://github.com/umano/MultiItemRowListAdapter);
- UniversalImageLoader (https://github.com/giorgiofellipe/Android-Universal-Image-Loader);
